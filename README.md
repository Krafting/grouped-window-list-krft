# grouped-window-list@krafting.net
A crappy fork of GWL on cinnamon, it enable "Show all windows from all monitor" by default (might have broken the workspace thing tho)

# Should I use it ?
Yeah sure, I mean it has been modified in less than an hour, and I had no clue of how to modifying it before starting, so, use it at your own risks

# Known issues ?
I think it works only for 2 monitors setup.. but I'm not even sure it works after a restart, I need to test it more

Will probably break, don't know yet

# How to install ? 
 
 ```git clone https://github.com/Krafting/grouped-window-list-krafting.net.git```
 
 then move the ```grouped-window-list@krafting.net``` folder to ```/usr/share/cinnamon/applets```
 
 step 3, profit
 
 # Contributing ?
 yes please, help me
